# JS-object-constructor-and-prototype

I was preparing for one of my Library project and then I got to know about the objects prototype.


So because dive deep into prototype, We have to know about the object construtor. 
then study about the use of constructor and how it  impacts and make our code more clear

Objects constructor is same as class constructor.

And then We have to study about the object prototype which is nothing but a copy of every object that javscript make whenever we create a new object.

so If we want to add method to parent object we can also use prototype in that case, in can help to keep the code cleaner. Without chancing someone else code we can add that method 
and its child object can also  inherit that method. If other developer and team satify with that method used in the prototype later they can add it to the main parent object.


{ As I am also learning new concept so Feel free to correct me I may be wrong but I think this is how we learn}

Cheers!!
